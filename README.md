# Branded Website Template / Base Shell

Our Branded Websites are built and powered by [`Svelte`](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This specific instance is our template or base shell. Always use this package when starting a new project.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
